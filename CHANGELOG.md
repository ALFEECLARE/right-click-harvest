## Changelog

### Features

- Add a tag, `rightclickharvest:hoe_required`, that defines blocks that require a hoe to be harvested when `requireHoe`
  is set in the config. These are the default values (although they can of course be extended with datapacks):
  - Wheat
  - Carrots
  - Beetroots
  - Potatoes

### Fixes

- Seeds are now dropped (#16).

Closed Issues: #16.
